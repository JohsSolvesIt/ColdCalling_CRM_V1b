# Notification Sound Placeholder
# 
# This file serves as a placeholder for notification2.mp3
# The script will attempt to play this file, but will fall back to system beep
# if no audio player is available.
#
# To add a real notification sound:
# 1. Replace this file with an actual notification2.mp3 audio file
# 2. Or install mpg123, ffplay, or another audio player
# 3. The script supports: paplay, aplay, mpg123, ffplay
