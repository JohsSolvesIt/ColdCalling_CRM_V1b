## ðŸ”§ Debugging Steps Applied

I've added debugging and safety measures to help identify the exact issue:

### 1. Enhanced Debugging in `enhanceImageQuality`
- Added console logging to show when the method is called
- Added logging to show the `this` object properties
- This will help us understand the context and scope

### 2. Safety Check in `normalizeImageUrl`
- Added a check to verify `this.enhanceImageQuality` exists before calling it
- Added warning message if method is not found
- This prevents the error and shows us what's happening

### Next Steps:
1. **Reload the Chrome extension** (hard refresh)
2. **Test the extraction again** on the Realtor page
3. **Check browser console** for the new debug messages

### What to Look For:
- Does the safety check trigger? (Warning about method not found)
- Do we see the debugging logs from `enhanceImageQuality`?
- What does the `this` object contain?

This will help us determine if:
- The method exists but isn't bound properly
- The method doesn't exist at all
- There's a scope/context issue
- The class isn't being instantiated correctly

### If the issue persists:
The problem might be:
1. **Class instantiation issue** - The class isn't being created properly
2. **Method binding issue** - The `this` context is lost
3. **Execution context issue** - Code is running before class is defined
4. **Extension loading issue** - Multiple scripts interfering
